Egit/MyAgSource Project setup

Note: In all places, MyAgSource currently has its
M, A and S capitalized.  This is important when creating
directories, entering URLs, etc.

1. To get started, first get a working copy of Zend Eclipse.
You will find this at the hidden URL of:
http://www.eclipse.org/pdt/downloads
(pdt meaning php developer tools)

2. Extract the zip file to the directory you'd like Eclipse in.
I personally avoid the program files directory due to its
virtualization issues in recent versions of Windows.  I went with
just C:\Eclipse

3. Run Eclipse.  You may also want to right-click on the executable
and pin it to taskbar and/or start menu.

4a. Next, in Eclipse, go to Help>Check for Updates.

4b.While Eclipse is updating itself, get a login for the feweb
server from the linux server admin (currently Rich Pinkall-Pollei).
He will email you your new login and password.

4c. When done, Eclipse will ask to restart.

5. Go to Help> Install New Software.  In the Work With: box, enter:
download.eclipse.org/egit/updates

6. In Eclipse, go to Window>Show View>Other...
From the list choose Git>Git Repositories

7. With the view open, click Clone a repository

8. Follow the steps.  Be sure the repository is being copied
to C:\Users\<yourwinloginname>\git\MyAgSource.
You'll also need the URI.  URI for the MyAgsource repository is:
ssh://kmarshall@feweb.verona.crinet/var/local/repos/MyAgsource
Substitue my login with yours, enter your password and check
Keep in Secure Store so you can "Commit and Push", etc without
having to enter your password each time.

9. Go to File>New > PHP Project from Existing directory
Select the new clone in your local git folder
For example: C:\Users\<yourwinloginname>\git\MyAgsource
and follow the remaining steps (everything should already
be correct... don't import existing projects, there are none).

10. Install a copy of ZendServer on your machine.  Be sure to
install it to C:\Program Files (x86)\.  This will put it in
the same place as the other developers for ease of debugging.
If done properly, Apache's deployment folder htdocs will be:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Zend\Apache2\htdocs

11. Navigate to htdocs in Windows Explorer (file browser).
Make a new folder in htdocs called MyAgSource.

12. Once Zend Server is installed, the MyAgSource directory is
made and the project is loaded in Eclipse's PHP Explorer, right
click on the topmost project folder and go to Properties.
Choose Automatic Upload.  First, enable it and choose local
connection.  Then browse to:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Zend\Apache2\htdocs\MyAgSource.
Hit OK to select it for your local connection.
IMPORTANT - Local Connection should point to:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Zend\Apache2\htdocs\MyAgSource
It is important the folder name for the local connection
should be the same as other programmers' on the same project
so urls on each machine are identical for troubleshooting
purposes.  Hit Ok when done.

13. If it works properly, you'll get 2 prompts: the first will
be Eclipse wanting to establish write privileges, the 2nd wanting
to perform an upload now.  Click Ok/Yes to both.

14. Get a working copy of index.php from a colleague index.php.
It should not be tracked and SHOULD be ignored as each machine in
turn will need index.php to be configured properly for CodeIgniter
to work with your machine's directory structure.
index.php should have its environment variable set to 'development'
for programmers' machines, 'testing' for the test server and
'production' for the live server.  Save a copy of index.php to your
htdocs/MyAgSource directory and then you can add it to the project
via File>Import.
  
15. You will also need to get a copy of the as_sys folder and put it
in your Apache2 folder (same folder your htdocs directory is in).
as_sys contains MyAgSource's custom codeigniter system files.

16. Finally, you may need to change the php.ini file in your
C:\Program Files (x86\Zend\ZendServer\etc\ folder.  Do a search for
date.timezone, uncomment it (remove the semi-colon) and change it to:
date.timezone = "America/Chicago"

17. If you've done everything correctly, opening up Google Chrome
and navigating to:
http://localhost/MyAgsource/
will load the MyAgSource site on your local machine.

Final Note: When everything is working, saving a file in Eclipse
will automatically upload it to Apache's deployment folder (the
local connection we specified above).  You can then refresh the
site on localhost and be able to see your changes immediately.
If your changes work correctly, right-click the file and Team>Commit...
Enter a description of your change into the git comment box and then
click Commit and Push to upload the change to the test server
repository.  The test server repository in turn uploads the changes
to the test server's apache instance via a git hook.  Also by pushing,
you are making your changes available on our common remote repository.
The other programmers can then get your changes with a simple Team>Pull.
To test the Commit and Push feature, feel free to alter dummy.php and
Commit and Push your changes to the feweb remote repository.

Now you're all set to start development on MyAgsource.  Good luck!
